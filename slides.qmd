# Overview: Focus & Comfort increase Disclosure

- Consumers tend to be \textbf{more self-disclosing on their smartphones}  due to feelings of \textbf{comfort}  and narrow attentional \textbf{focus} 
- This tendency is found in a \textbf{wide range of domains}  including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with \textbf{requests for personal information}  in web advertisements
- Important \textbf{marketing implications}, e.g. conducting consumer surveys via smartphones, ideally with text boxes to leverages attentional focus

# Highlights: Study 1 --- Depth of Disclosure Across Devices on Twitter
- Dataset of 369,161 tweets containing trending hashtags within a 12-hour period in December 2015, covering various topical domains, to investigate potential disparities between smartphones and PCs.
- \textbf{Dictionary approach}  to express content of the text in 6 dimensions
- Suplemented with \textbf{human ratings}  of tweets for two hashtag categories
- Both analysis yield that the level of \textbf{self-disclosure is statistically different}  between smartphones and PCs
- Reproduced with other tweet-datasets

# Lowlights: The presented framework

![Theoretical model from @melumadFullDisclosureHow2020](figure1.png){width=70%}

\small \textit{"Notes: The model hypothesizes two parallel causal paths of mediation: one stemming from greater focus on the disclosure at hand, and the other through feelings of enhanced psychological comfort on the device."}

The `Device` \textbf{confounds}  `Attentional Focus` and `Psychological Comfort`. 
\vspace{0.5cm}

However, parts of the paper suggest a \textbf{direct effect} of `Smartphone vs PC` on `Depth of Disclosure`?

# Discussion: Open Questions, Limitations & Extensions

- "I do not buy these types of products" --- Why is this rated as a "non-comply"?
- What about \textbf{spelling assistance} on smartphones?
- What is the role of \textbf{shame}? Is it part of `Psychological Comfort`?
- What about other devices  e.g. \textbf{Virtual Reality}?
- Would the smarphone ads also have a higher \textbf{ROI}?
- \textbf{Ethics}  of managerial implications?
